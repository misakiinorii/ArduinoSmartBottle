The core mechanism relies on the electrical conductivity of water; we inserted metal pins at specific height intervals, with a common ground pin at the bottom to complete the circuit. My code, written in Arduino C++ interprets the binary signals from these pins to calculate the remaining volume based on which circuits are broken.
